Summer brings with it the release of three articles talking
about three different (and each arguably essential) ideas from
the Haskell landscape.  The first is an in-depth tutorial about
generalized algebraic data types, covering all of the classic
use-cases of this useful type system extension.  The second is
a meditation on the design pattern of monad transformers, and how
they can help the develop the design of a parser library.  The
final shows how even a simple API like that of a monoid can
help code achieve dramatic speed-ups.  Happy reading!
